### KyOSC

Based on Ahmet Kizilay's [AndrOSC](https://github.com/ahmetkizilay/AndrOSC)

An app for Android to use OSC from your device 
with the ability to design graphical templates 
within the app. 

This fork fixes the build for current platforms, fixes a bug when multiple buttons sent all the same code, adds button release event, ...

I plan to add more functions and to fix some issues reported to the original project.

#### Available Controllers
* OSC_Button 
* OSC_Toggle
* OSC_Pad
* OSC_VSlider
* OSC_HSlider

#### Installation
There are some debug .apk's in the [Releases section](https://github.com/premek/kyosc/releases).
- download the .apk to your android device
- enable 'unknown sources' in your settings (the location of the option depends on the brand of your device)
- use any file browser on your android device to locate the .apk file, click it and install
